# Royal


## Intro

`royal` is a library and framework for handling graph data. Unlike other data file formats or libraries, `royal` specializes in storing relationships between objects and data points. `royal` is not a graph database, it allows abstraction and processing of
graph relationships in the form of transportable data.


## Development Status

Royal is currently in the alpha development phase.
